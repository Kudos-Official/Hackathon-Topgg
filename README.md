This Bot Is Made By `Mr.Respected#9999` and `ItzJust_Prime#9636`

When this bot was made, the bot did not use a json database. However, the database used previously unexpectedly crashed. Due to lack of time(and resources), the bot had to use a json database. Some things in the code might not sound the easiest way to do it, however this was due to the fact that the database took us more than 2 days to reform(we had to wait for a while to realize that the database crash, which was from the side of the database itself, won't be fixed anytime soon), so that explains any such thing that might not be the best way.

We hope you like it! <3
