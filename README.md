This Bot Is Made By `Mr.Respected#9999` and `ItzJust_Prime#9636`

When this bot was made, the bot did not use a json database. However, the database used previously unexpectedly crashed. Thinking it would be fixed from their end, we decided to wait for a while. However, our wait went to no avail, because it wasn't fixed from their end. Due to lack of time(when we got to know that the database won't be fixed anytime soon, it was already 17th December) and resources, the bot had to use a json database. Some things in the code might not sound the easiest way to do it, however this was due to the fact that even the json database took us more than hours to reform when the project was to be submitted on the same day, so that explains any such thing that might not be the best way. We are well aware this is one of the worst, rather the worst way to store values/data, we had no choice in the last few hours of submitting the bot.

We hope you like it!
